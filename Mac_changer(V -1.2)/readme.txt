Hello Guys I have finally updated this python script hope will be helpful

its not much complicated to use like the older version

just follow thease steps

1. first download the zip or git clone the url
2. the navigate to the directory where you cloned the url 
3. Now just copy thease commands 
cd "Mac_changer(V -1.2)"
python mac_changer.py --help
now you will get a proper thing just put eth0 for changing MAC of ethernet 
and wlan0 for changing MAC of wifi 
-i for interface like eth0
and -m for any mac you want but in syntax of 12:12:12:12:12:12
this will not change permanently
